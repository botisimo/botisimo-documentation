        botisimo: A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has no positive integer divisors other than 1 and itself. In other words, a prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself. Examples of prime numbers include 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, and so on. Prime numbers have fascinated mathematicians for centuries and have practical applications in cryptography and computer science.
