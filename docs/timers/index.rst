Timers
======

Timers are used to automate messages based on time interval and chat activity. This is a great way to promote your brand and your message. Timers are often used to do things like promote social media channels or remind people to like, follow, and subscribe so they know when you are going to be live next.

Timer responses are often made up of text that combines :doc:`response variables <../../variables/index>` and :doc:`response directives <../../directives/index>` to achieve dynamic output.

You can create timers by visiting the `timers page <https://botisimo.com/account/timers>`_ and clicking on **"+ Create New"**.
