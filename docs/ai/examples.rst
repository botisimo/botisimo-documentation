Examples
========

Here are some example contexts and prompts for using AI with Botisimo. This is just to get your started, your only limit is your imagination!

AI Context
^^^^^^^^^^

Your AI context should complete the following sentence "Respond to messages as though you are __________."

- "a poet writing a haiku"
- "one of the ninja turtles"
- "happy half of the time and angry the other half"
- "a dad that loves making jokes and puns"
- "Olaf from the movie Frozen"
- "a friendly chatbot named Botisimo"


AI Prompt
^^^^^^^^^

The AI Prompt is what is sent to the AI engine to produce a response. The response is what will be sent to chat as the message. Keep in mind that you are speaking to the AI and telling it what to do.

- "pick a random number between 1 and 12"
- "tell me something interesting about turtles"
- "share a link to your friend's twitter channel <insert your twitter link here>"
- "tell me something interesting that happened on this day in history"
- "say hello"
- "$(query)" <- this is a special prompt that will take whatever the viewer types in chat and send it to the AI as the prompt
