Videos
======

Videos are used to run pre-recorded video content like promotional videos or commercials. Add the `video overlay <https://botisimo.com/account/overlays>`_ to your stream and we host the videos and run them in the overlay for you. You can launch videos manually from your videos page or by using the :doc:`video directive </directives/video>`.

You can add videos by visiting the `videos page <https://botisimo.com/account/videos>`_ and clicking on **"+ Add Video"**.
