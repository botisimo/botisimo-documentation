Directives
==========

Response directives are used to make dynamic actions for your `custom commands <https://botisimo.com/account/commands>`_ and `timers <https://botisimo.com/account/timers>`_. Directives will be processed after :doc:`response variables <variables/index>` and in the order they appear in the response text.

.. note::

    If a directive argument is required it will be wrapped in ``<`` ``>`` and if the argument is optional it will be wrapped in ``[`` ``]``.
