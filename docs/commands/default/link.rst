!link
=====

**Default Permission:** Everyone

The ``!link`` command is used to link users from different platforms together to share currency and XP. Each group of linked users can have 1 user from each platform linked (Twitch, Mixer, YouTube, and Discord). You must have login access to the user account on each platform to be able to link them.

Link Users
^^^^^^^^^^

Log in to a chat platform (in this example we'll use Twitch) and join the channel with Botisimo and initiate the linking process by targeting another platform and username::

    (twitch) Player1: !link mixer Player1

If the targeted user is not in the system, you may need to log in and send a message in chat to allow Botisimo to register that user to the system. If the user is in the system, Botisimo will respond with instructions to complete the link::

    (twitch) Botisimo: Link initiated. Please log in to mixer as Player1 and type "!link twitch Player1" to finish linking with Player1 [twitch]

Log in to the your user on the other platform (in this example we are using Mixer) and complete the link::

    (mixer) Player1: !link twitch Player1

If everything is correct, Botisimo will let you know your users have been linked::

    (mixer) Botisimo: Player1 [mixer] has been linked with Player1 [twitch]

That's it! To link another user you would just repeat the steps::

    (twitch) Player1: !link discord Player1
    (twitch) Botisimo: Link initiated. Please log in to discord as Player1 and type "!link twitch Player1" to finish linking with Player1 [twitch], Player1 [mixer]

::

    (discord) Player1: !link twitch Player1
    (discord) Botisimo: Player1 [discord] has been linked with Player1 [twitch], Player1 [mixer]

Check Linked Users
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can use ``!link`` to see what users are linked together::

    (twitch) Player1: !link
    (twitch) Botisimo: Player1 [twitch], Player1 [mixer], Player1 [discord]

Unlink Users
^^^^^^^^^^^^

To unlink a user you can target a platform with the ``!unlink`` command::

    (twitch) Player1: !unlink discord
    (twitch) Botisimo: Player1 [discord] has been unlinked
    (twitch) Player1: !link
    (twitch) Botisimo: Player1 [twitch], Player1 [mixer]
