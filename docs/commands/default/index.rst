Default Commands
================

Default commands are the commands that come built-in to Botisimo. See below for the complete list. Click on any command to see how it works.

You can change the minimum permissions or disable any of the default commands by visiting the `commands page <https://botisimo.com/account/commands>`_ and clicking on "Edit Default Command Permissions".

.. note::

    If a command argument is required it will be wrapped in ``<`` ``>`` and if the argument is optional it will be wrapped in ``[`` ``]``.

.. note::

    If viewers are not receiving whispers from Botisimo in Twitch, they may need to send it a whisper first to get it working for their account.
