Custom
======

Custom commands are commands created by you.

Custom command responses are often made up of text that combines :doc:`response variables <../../variables/index>` and :doc:`response directives <../../directives/index>` to achieve dynamic output.

You can create custom commands by visiting the `commands page <https://botisimo.com/account/commands>`_ and clicking on **"+ Create New"**.
